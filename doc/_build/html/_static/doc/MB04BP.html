<PRE>
  To compute the eigenvalues of a real N-by-N skew-Hamiltonian/
  Hamiltonian pencil aS - bH with

        (  A  D  )         (  C  V  )
    S = (        ) and H = (        ).                           (1)
        (  E  A' )         (  W -C' )

  Optionally, if JOB = 'T', decompositions of S and H will be
  computed via orthogonal transformations Q1 and Q2 as follows:

                    (  Aout  Dout  )
    Q1' S J Q1 J' = (              ),
                    (   0    Aout' )

                    (  Bout  Fout  )
    J' Q2' J S Q2 = (              ) =: T,                       (2)
                    (   0    Bout' )

               (  C1out  Vout  )            (  0  I  )
    Q1' H Q2 = (               ), where J = (        )
               (  0     C2out' )            ( -I  0  )

  and Aout, Bout, C1out are upper triangular, C2out is upper quasi-
  triangular and Dout and Fout are skew-symmetric. The notation M'
  denotes the transpose of the matrix M.
  Optionally, if COMPQ1 = 'I' or COMPQ1 = 'U', then the orthogonal
  transformation matrix Q1 will be computed.
  Optionally, if COMPQ2 = 'I' or COMPQ2 = 'U', then the orthogonal
  transformation matrix Q2 will be computed.

<PRE>
  JOB     CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the computation to be performed, as follows:
          = 'E': compute the eigenvalues only; S and H will not
                 necessarily be transformed as in (2).
          = 'T': put S and H into the forms in (2) and return the
                 eigenvalues in ALPHAR, ALPHAI and BETA.

  COMPQ1  CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether to compute the orthogonal transformation
          matrix Q1, as follows:
          = 'N':  Q1 is not computed;
          = 'I':  the array Q1 is initialized internally to the unit
                  matrix, and the orthogonal matrix Q1 is returned;
          = 'U':  the array Q1 contains an orthogonal matrix Q on
                  entry, and the product Q*Q1 is returned, where Q1
                  is the product of the orthogonal transformations
                  that are applied to the pencil aS - bH to reduce
                  S and H to the forms in (2), for COMPQ1 = 'I'.

  COMPQ2  CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether to compute the orthogonal transformation
          matrix Q2, as follows:
          = 'N':  Q2 is not computed;
          = 'I':  on exit, the array Q2 contains the orthogonal
                  matrix Q2;
          = 'U':  on exit, the array Q2 contains the matrix product
                  J*Q*J'*Q2, where Q2 is the product of the
                  orthogonal transformations that are applied to
                  the pencil aS - bH to reduce S and H to the forms
                  in (2), for COMPQ2 = 'I'.
                  Setting COMPQ2 &lt;&gt; 'N' assumes COMPQ2 = COMPQ1.

          On entry, the leading N/2-by-N/2 lower triangular part of
          this array must contain the lower triangular part of the

          triangular part of the skew-symmetric matrix F just before
          the application of the periodic QZ algorithm.
          The entries on the leading N/2-by-N/2 lower triangular
          part of this array are not referenced.

  LDF     INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array F.  LDF &gt;= MAX(1, N/2).

  C2      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDC2, N/2)
          On exit, if JOB = 'T', the leading N/2-by-N/2 part of this
          array contains the matrix C2out; otherwise, it contains
          the upper Hessenberg matrix C2 obtained just before the
          application of the periodic QZ algorithm.

  LDC2    INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array C2.
          LDC2 &gt;= MAX(1, N/2).

  ALPHAR  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N/2)
          The real parts of each scalar alpha defining an eigenvalue
          of the pencil aS - bH.

  ALPHAI  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N/2)
          The imaginary parts of each scalar alpha defining an
          eigenvalue of the pencil aS - bH.
          If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th eigenvalue is real.

  BETA    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N/2)
          The scalars beta that define the eigenvalues of the pencil
          aS - bH.
          Together, the quantities alpha = (ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j)) and
          beta = BETA(j) represent the j-th eigenvalue of the pencil
          aS - bH, in the form lambda = alpha/beta. Since lambda may
          overflow, the ratios should not, in general, be computed.
          Due to the skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian structure of the
          pencil, for every eigenvalue lambda, -lambda is also an
          eigenvalue, and thus it has only to be saved once in
          ALPHAR, ALPHAI and BETA.
          Specifically, only eigenvalues with imaginary parts
          greater than or equal to zero are stored; their conjugate
          eigenvalues are not stored. If imaginary parts are zero
          (i.e., for real eigenvalues), only positive eigenvalues
          are stored. The remaining eigenvalues have opposite signs.
          As a consequence, pairs of complex eigenvalues, stored in
          consecutive locations, are not complex conjugate.

<B>Workspace</B>
<PRE>
  IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (LIWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 3, IWORK(1) contains the number of
          (pairs of) possibly inaccurate eigenvalues, q &lt;= N/2, and
          IWORK(2), ..., IWORK(q+1) indicate their indices.
          Specifically, a positive value is an index of a real or
          purely imaginary eigenvalue, corresponding to a 1-by-1
          block, while the absolute value of a negative entry in
          IWORK is an index to the first eigenvalue in a pair of
          consecutively stored eigenvalues, corresponding to a
          2-by-2 block. A 2-by-2 block may have two complex, two
          real, two purely imaginary, or one real and one purely
          imaginary eigenvalue.
          For i = q+2, ..., 2*q+1, IWORK(i) contains a pointer to
          the starting location in DWORK of the i-th quadruple of
          1-by-1 blocks, if IWORK(i-q) &gt; 0, or 2-by-2 blocks,
          if IWORK(i-q) &lt; 0, defining unreliable eigenvalues.
          IWORK(2*q+2) contains the number of the 1-by-1 blocks, and
          IWORK(2*q+3) contains the number of the 2-by-2 blocks,
          corresponding to unreliable eigenvalues. IWORK(2*q+4)
          contains the total number t of the 2-by-2 blocks.
          If INFO = 0, then q = 0, therefore IWORK(1) = 0.

  LIWORK  INTEGER
          The dimension of the array IWORK.  LIWORK &gt;= N+12.

  DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0 or INFO = 3, DWORK(1) returns the
          optimal LDWORK, and DWORK(2), ..., DWORK(5) contain the
          Frobenius norms of the factors of the formal matrix
          product used by the algorithm. In addition, DWORK(6), ...,
          DWORK(5+4*s) contain the s quadruple values corresponding
          to the 1-by-1 blocks. Their eigenvalues are real or purely
          imaginary. Such an eigenvalue is obtained from
          -i*sqrt(a1*a3/a2/a4), but always taking a positive sign,
          where a1, ..., a4 are the corresponding quadruple values.
          Moreover, DWORK(6+4*s), ..., DWORK(5+4*s+16*t) contain the
          t groups of quadruple 2-by-2 matrices corresponding to the
          2-by-2 blocks. Their eigenvalue pairs are either complex,
          or placed on the real and imaginary axes. Such an
          eigenvalue pair is obtained as -1i*sqrt(ev), but taking
          positive imaginary parts, where ev are the eigenvalues of
          the product A1*inv(A2)*A3*inv(A4), where A1, ..., A4
          define the corresponding 2-by-2 matrix quadruple.
          On exit, if INFO = -27, DWORK(1) returns the minimum value
          of LDWORK.

  LDWORK  INTEGER
          The dimension of the array DWORK.
          If JOB = 'E' and COMPQ1 = 'N' and COMPQ2 = 'N',
             LDWORK &gt;= N**2 + MAX(L,36);
          if JOB = 'T' or COMPQ1 &lt;&gt; 'N' or COMPQ2 &lt;&gt; 'N',
             LDWORK &gt;= 2*N**2 + MAX(L,36);
          where
             L = 4*N + 4, if N/2 is even, and
             L = 4*N,     if N/2 is odd.
          For good performance LDWORK should generally be larger.

  The algorithm uses Givens rotations and Householder reflections to
  annihilate elements in S, T, and H such that A, B, and C1 are
  upper triangular and C2 is upper Hessenberg. Finally, the periodic
  QZ algorithm is applied to transform C2 to upper quasi-triangular
  form while A, B, and C1 stay in upper triangular form.

  For large values of N, the routine applies the transformations
  for reducing T on panels of columns. The user may specify in INFO
  the desired number of columns. If on entry INFO &lt; 0, then the
  routine estimates a suitable value of this number. If INFO = 0,
  the routine MB04BD is directly called.
