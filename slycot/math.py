    To determine whether or not a given polynomial P(x) with real

    A polynomial is said to be stable in the continuous-time case
    if all its zeros lie in the left half-plane, and stable in the
    discrete-time case if all its zeros lie inside the unit circle.

            = 'D':  discrete-time case.

    Further Comments
    ----------------

    Each matrix Q_j is represented as a product of (ihi-ilo)
    elementary reflectors,

       Q_j = H_j(ilo) H_j(ilo+1) . . . H_j(ihi-1).

    Each H_j(i), i = ilo, ..., ihi-1, has the form

       H_j(i) = I - tau_j * v_j * v_j',

    where tau_j is a real scalar, and v_j is a real vector with
    v_j(1:i) = 0, v_j(i+1) = 1 and v_j(ihi+1:n) = 0; v_j(i+2:ihi)
    is stored on exit in A_j(i+2:ihi,i), and tau_j in TAU(i,j).

    The contents of A_1 are illustrated by the following example
    for n = 7, ilo = 2, and ihi = 6:

    on entry                         on exit

    ( a   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( a   h   h   h   h   h   a )

    ( 0   0   0   0   0   0   a )    ( 0   0   0   0   0   0   a )

    where a denotes an element of the original matrix A_1, h denotes
    a modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H_1, and vi
    denotes an element of the vector defining H_1(i).

    The contents of A_j, j > 1, are illustrated by the following
    example for n = 7, ilo = 2, and ihi = 6:

    on entry                         on exit

    ( a   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( a   h   h   h   h   h   a )
    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   h   h   h   h   h   h )
    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   v2  h   h   h   h   h )
    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   v2  v3  h   h   h   h )
    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   v2  v3  v4  h   h   h )
    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   v2  v3  v4  v5  h   h )
    ( 0   0   0   0   0   0   a )    ( 0   0   0   0   0   0   a )

    where a denotes an element of the original matrix A_j, h denotes
    a modified element of the upper triangular matrix H_j, and vi
    denotes an element of the vector defining H_j(i). (The element
    (1,2) in A_p is also unchanged for this example.)

    Note that for P = 1, the LAPACK Library routine DGEHRD could be
    more efficient on some computer architectures than this routine
    (a BLAS 2 version).

        Ar : output rank-2 array('d') with bounds (n,n)
            Contains the solution matrix exp(A*delta)
        Vr : output rank-2 array('d') with bounds (n,n)
            Contains the eigenvector matrix for A.  If the k-th
            eigenvalue is real the k-th column of the eigenvector
            matrix holds the eigenvector corresponding to the k-th
            eigenvalue.  Otherwise, the k-th and (k+1)-th eigenvalues
            form a complex conjugate pair and the k-th and (k+1)-th
            columns of the eigenvector matrix hold the real and
            imaginary parts of the eigenvectors corresponding to these
            eigenvalues as follows.  If p and q denote the k-th and
            (k+1)-th columns of the eigenvector matrix, respectively,
            then the eigenvector corresponding to the complex
            eigenvalue with positive (negative) imaginary value is
            given by
              p + q*j (p - q*j), where j^2  = -1.
        Yr : output rank-2 array('d') with bounds (n,n)
            contains an intermediate result for computing the matrix
            exponential.  Specifically, exp(A*delta) is obtained as the
            product V*Y, where V is the matrix stored in the leading
            N-by-N part of the array V. If all eigenvalues of A are
            real, then the leading N-by-N part of this array contains
            the matrix product exp(Lambda*delta) times the inverse of
            the (right) eigenvector matrix of A, where Lambda is the
            diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

        VAL : output rank-1 array('c') with bounds (n)
            Contains the eigenvalues of the matrix A. The eigenvalues
            are unordered except that complex conjugate pairs of values
            appear consecutively with the eigenvalue having positive
            imaginary part first.
