def mb03rd(n, A, X=None, jobx='U', sort='N', pmax=1.0, tol=0.0):
    """Ar, Xr, blsize, W = mb03rd(n, A, [X, jobx, sort, pmax, tol])

    To reduce a matrix `A` in real Schur form to a block-diagonal form
    using well-conditioned non-orthogonal similarity transformations.
    The condition numbers of the transformations used for reduction
    are roughly bounded by `pmax`*`pmax`, where `pmax` is a given value.
    The transformations are optionally postmultiplied in a given
    matrix `X`. The real Schur form is optionally ordered, so that
    clustered eigenvalues are grouped in the same block.

    Parameters
    ----------
        n : int
            The order of the matrices `A` and `X`.  `n` >= 0.
        A : (n, n) array_like
            The matrix `A` to be block-diagonalized, in real Schur form.
        X : (n, n) array_like, optional
            A given matrix `X`, for accumulation of transformations (only if
            `jobx`='U'). Default value is identity matrix of order `n`.
        jobx : {'N', 'U'}, optional
            Specifies whether or not the transformations are
            accumulated, as follows:

            := 'N': The transformations are not accumulated
            := 'U': The transformations are accumulated in `Xr` (default)

        sort : {'N', 'S', 'C', 'B'}, optional
            Specifies whether or not the diagonal blocks of the real
            Schur form are reordered, as follows:

            := 'N':  The diagonal blocks are not reordered (default);
            := 'S':  The diagonal blocks are reordered before each
                     step of reduction, so that clustered eigenvalues
                     appear in the same block;
            := 'C':  The diagonal blocks are not reordered, but the
                     "closest-neighbour" strategy is used instead of
                     the standard "closest to the mean" strategy
                     (see Notes_);
            := 'B':  The diagonal blocks are reordered before each
                     step of reduction, and the "closest-neighbour"
                     strategy is used (see Notes_).

        pmax : float, optional
            An upper bound for the infinity norm of elementary
            submatrices of the individual transformations used for
            reduction (see Notes_).  `pmax` >= 1.0
        tol : float, optional
            The tolerance to be used in the ordering of the diagonal
            blocks of the real Schur form matrix.
            If the user sets `tol` > 0, then the given value of `tol` is
            used as an absolute tolerance: a block `i` and a temporarily
            fixed block 1 (the first block of the current trailing
            submatrix to be reduced) are considered to belong to the
            same cluster if their eigenvalues satisfy

            .. math:: | \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_i | <= tol.

            If the user sets `tol` < 0, then the given value of tol is
            used as a relative tolerance: a block i and a temporarily
            fixed block 1 are considered to belong to the same cluster
            if their eigenvalues satisfy, for ``j = 1, ..., n``

            .. math:: | \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_i | <= | tol | * \\max | \\lambda_j |.

            If the user sets `tol` = 0, then an implicitly computed,
            default tolerance, defined by ``tol = SQRT( SQRT( EPS ) )``
            is used instead, as a relative tolerance, where `EPS` is
            the machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
            If `sort` = 'N' or 'C', this parameter is not referenced.

    Returns
    -------
        Ar : (n, n) ndarray
            Contains the computed block-diagonal matrix, in real Schur
            canonical form. The non-diagonal blocks are set to zero.
        Xr : (n, n) ndarray or None
            Contains the product of the given matrix `X` and the
            transformation matrix that reduced `A` to block-diagonal
            form. The transformation matrix is itself a product of
            non-orthogonal similarity transformations having elements
            with magnitude less than or equal to `pmax`.
            If `jobx` = 'N', this array is returned as None
        blsize : (n,) ndarray
            The orders of the resulting diagonal blocks of the matrix `Ar`.
        W : (n,) complex ndarray
            Contains the complex eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.

    Notes
    -----
    **Method**

    Consider first that `sort` = 'N'. Let

    ::

           ( A    A   )
           (  11   12 )
       A = (          ),
           ( 0    A   )
           (       22 )

    be the given matrix in real Schur form, where initially :math:`A_{11}` is the
    first diagonal block of dimension 1-by-1 or 2-by-2. An attempt is
    made to compute a transformation matrix `X` of the form

    ::

           ( I   P )
       X = (       )                                               (1)
           ( 0   I )

    (partitioned as `A`), so that

    ::

                ( A     0  )
        -1      (  11      )
       X  A X = (          ),
                ( 0    A   )
                (       22 )

    and the elements of `P` do not exceed the value `pmax` in magnitude.
    An adaptation of the standard method for solving Sylvester
    equations [1]_, which controls the magnitude of the individual
    elements of the computed solution [2]_, is used to obtain matrix `P`.
    When this attempt failed, an 1-by-1 (or 2-by-2) diagonal block of
    :math:`A_{22}`  , whose eigenvalue(s) is (are) the closest to the mean of those
    of :math:`A_{11}`   is selected, and moved by orthogonal similarity
    transformations in the leading position of :math:`A_{22}`  ; the moved diagonal
    block is then added to the block :math:`A_{11}`  , increasing its order by 1
    (or 2). Another attempt is made to compute a suitable
    transformation matrix X with the new definitions of the blocks :math:`A_{11}`
    and :math:`A_{22}`  . After a successful transformation matrix `X` has been
    obtained, it postmultiplies the current transformation matrix
    (if `jobx` = 'U'), and the whole procedure is repeated for the
    matrix :math:`A_{22}`.

    When `sort` = 'S', the diagonal blocks of the real Schur form are
    reordered before each step of the reduction, so that each cluster
    of eigenvalues, defined as specified in the definition of TOL,
    appears in adjacent blocks. The blocks for each cluster are merged
    together, and the procedure described above is applied to the
    larger blocks. Using the option `sort` = 'S' will usually provide
    better efficiency than the standard option (`sort` = 'N'), proposed
    in [2]_, because there could be no or few unsuccessful attempts
    to compute individual transformation matrices `X` of the form (1).
    However, the resulting dimensions of the blocks are usually
    larger; this could make subsequent calculations less efficient.

    When `sort` = 'C' or 'B', the procedure is similar to that for
    `sort` = 'N' or 'S', respectively, but the block of :math:`A_{22}` whose
    eigenvalue(s) is (are) the closest to those of :math:`A_{11}` (not to their
    mean) is selected and moved to the leading position of :math:`A_{22}`. This
    is called the "closest-neighbour" strategy.

    **Numerical Aspects**

    The algorithm usually requires :math:`\\mathcal{O}(N^3)` operations,
    but :math:`\\mathcal{O}(N^4)` are
    possible in the worst case, when all diagonal blocks in the real
    Schur form of `A` are 1-by-1, and the matrix cannot be diagonalized
    by well-conditioned transformations.

    **Further Comments**

    The individual non-orthogonal transformation matrices used in the
    reduction of `A` to a block-diagonal form have condition numbers
    of the order `pmax`*`pmax`. This does not guarantee that their product
    is well-conditioned enough. The routine can be easily modified to
    provide estimates for the condition numbers of the clusters of
    eigenvalues.

            scalar factors of the elementary reflectors used to form
            the matrix Q_j, j = 1, ..., p. See FURTHER COMMENTS.

    Further Comments
    ----------------

    Each matrix Q_j is represented as a product of (ihi-ilo)
    elementary reflectors,

       Q_j = H_j(ilo) H_j(ilo+1) . . . H_j(ihi-1).

    Each H_j(i), i = ilo, ..., ihi-1, has the form

       H_j(i) = I - tau_j * v_j * v_j',

    where tau_j is a real scalar, and v_j is a real vector with
    v_j(1:i) = 0, v_j(i+1) = 1 and v_j(ihi+1:n) = 0; v_j(i+2:ihi)
    is stored on exit in A_j(i+2:ihi,i), and tau_j in TAU(i,j).

    The contents of A_1 are illustrated by the following example
    for n = 7, ilo = 2, and ihi = 6:

    on entry                         on exit

    ( a   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( a   h   h   h   h   h   a )

    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   h   h   h   h   h   h )
    ( 0   a   a   a   a   a   a )    ( 0   v2  h   h   h   h   h )

    ( 0   0   0   0   0   0   a )    ( 0   0   0   0   0   0   a )

    where a denotes an element of the original matrix A_1, h denotes
    a modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H_1, and vi
    denotes an element of the vector defining H_1(i).

    The contents of A_j, j > 1, are illustrated by the following
    example for n = 7, ilo = 2, and ihi = 6:

    on entry                         on exit

    a modified element of the upper triangular matrix H_j, and vi
    denotes an element of the vector defining H_j(i). (The element
    (1,2) in A_p is also unchanged for this example.)

def mb05md(a, delta, balanc='N'):
    """Ar, Vr, Yr, w = mb05md(a, delta, balanc='N')

    Matrix exponential for a real non-defective matrix

    To compute ``exp(A*delta)`` where `A` is a real N-by-N non-defective
    matrix with real or complex eigenvalues and delta is a scalar
    value. The routine also returns the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    of `A` as well as (if all eigenvalues are real) the matrix product
    ``exp(Lambda*delta)`` times the inverse of the eigenvector matrix of
    `A`, where `Lambda` is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
    Optionally, the routine computes a balancing transformation to
    improve the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : (n, n) array_like
        Square matrix
    delta : float
        The scalar value delta of the problem.
    balanc : {'N', 'S'}, optional
        Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
        to improve the conditioning of its eigenvalues as follows:

        := 'N':  Do not diagonally scale;
        := 'S':  Diagonally scale the matrix, i.e. replace `A` by
                 ``D*A*D**(-1)``, where `D` is a diagonal matrix chosen
                 to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
                 norm. Do not permute.

    Returns
    -------
    Ar : (n, n) ndarray
        Contains the solution matrix ``exp(A*delta)``
    Vr : (n, n) ndarray
        Contains the eigenvector matrix for `A`.  If the `k`-th
        eigenvalue is real the `k`-th column of the eigenvector
        matrix holds the eigenvector corresponding to the `k`-th
        eigenvalue.  Otherwise, the `k`-th and `(k+1)`-th eigenvalues
        form a complex conjugate pair and the k-th and `(k+1)`-th
        columns of the eigenvector matrix hold the real and
        imaginary parts of the eigenvectors corresponding to these
        eigenvalues as follows.  If `p` and `q` denote the `k`-th and
        `(k+1)`-th columns of the eigenvector matrix, respectively,
        then the eigenvector corresponding to the complex
        eigenvalue with positive (negative) imaginary value is
        given by
          ``p + q*j (p - q*j), where j^2  = -1.``
    Yr : (n, n) ndarray
        contains an intermediate result for computing the matrix
        exponential.  Specifically, ``exp(A*delta)`` is obtained as the
        product ``V*Y``, where `V` is the matrix stored in the leading
        `n`-by-`n` part of the array `V`. If all eigenvalues of `A` are
        real, then the leading `n`-by-`n` part of this array contains
        the matrix product ``exp(Lambda*delta)`` times the inverse of
        the (right) eigenvector matrix of `A`, where `Lambda` is the
        diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
    w : (n, ) real or complex ndarray
        Contains the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`. The eigenvalues
        are unordered except that complex conjugate pairs of values
        appear consecutively with the eigenvalue having positive
        imaginary part first.
