    """To preprocess the input-output data for estimating the matrices of a
    linear time-invariant dynamical system and to find an
    estimate of the system order. The input-output data can,
    optionally, be processed sequentially.

    Required arguments
    ------------------

        meth : {'M', 'N'}
             Specifies the subspace identification method to be used,
             as follows:
             = 'M':  MOESP  algorithm with past inputs and outputs;
             = 'N':  N4SID  algorithm.
        alg  : {'C', 'F', 'Q'}
             Specifies the algorithm for computing the triangular
             factor R, as follows:
             = 'C':  Cholesky algorithm applied to the correlation
                     matrix of the input-output data;
             = 'F':  Fast QR algorithm;
             = 'Q':  QR algorithm applied to the concatenated block
                     Hankel matrices.
        jobd : {'M', 'N'}
             Specifies whether or not the matrices B and D should later
             be computed using the MOESP approach, as follows:
             = 'M':  the matrices B and D should later be computed
                     using the MOESP approach;
             = 'N':  the matrices B and D should not be computed using
                     the MOESP approach.
             This parameter is not relevant for METH = 'N'.
        conct : {'C', 'N'}
             Specifies whether or not the successive data blocks in
             sequential data processing belong to a single experiment,
             as follows:
             = 'C':  the current data block is a continuation of the
                     previous data block and/or it will be continued
                     by the next data block;
             = 'N':  there is no connection between the current data
                     block and the previous and/or the next ones.
             This parameter is not used if BATCH = 'O'.

        ctrl : {'C', 'N'}
             Specifies whether or not the user's confirmation of the
             system order estimate is desired, as follows:
             = 'C':  user's confirmation;
             = 'N':  no confirmation.
             If  CTRL = 'C',  a reverse communication routine,  IB01OY,
             is indirectly called (by SLICOT Library routine IB01OD),
             and, after inspecting the singular values and system order
             estimate,  n,  the user may accept  n  or set a new value.
             IB01OY  is not called if CTRL = 'N'.
        nobr : int
              The number of block rows,  s,  in the input and output
              block Hankel matrices to be processed.  NOBR > 0.
              (In the MOESP theory,  NOBR  should be larger than  n,
              the estimated dimension of state vector.)
        data : [(u1, y1), (u2, y2)...]. A list of tuples containing experiment
               data of inputs and outputs. The number of inputs and number of
               outputs should be the same in every tuple. u1 has dimension
               (n1 x nu). y1 has dimension (n1 x ny). u2 has dimension (n2 x nu)

    Optional:

      rcond   DOUBLE
              The tolerance to be used for estimating the rank of
              matrices. If the user sets  RCOND > 0,  the given value
              of  RCOND  is used as a lower bound for the reciprocal
              condition number;  an m-by-n matrix whose estimated
              condition number is less than  1/RCOND  is considered to
              be of full rank.  If the user sets  RCOND <= 0,  then an
              implicitly computed, default tolerance, defined by
              RCONDEF = m*n*EPS,  is used instead, where  EPS  is the
              relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
              DLAMCH).
              This parameter is not used for  METH = 'M'.

      tol     DOUBLE
              Absolute tolerance used for determining an estimate of
              the system order. If  TOL >= 0,  the estimate is
              indicated by the index of the last singular value greater
              than or equal to  TOL.  (Singular values less than  TOL
              are considered as zero.) When  TOL = 0,  an internally
              computed default value,  TOL = NOBR*EPS*SV(1),  is used,
              where  SV(1)  is the maximal singular value, and  EPS  is
              the relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
              DLAMCH). When  TOL < 0,  the estimate is indicated by the
              index of the singular value that has the largest
              logarithmic gap to its successor.
    Outputs:

        R       (output) rank-2 array('d'), dimension
                ( LDR,2*(M+L)*NOBR )
                On exit, if ALG = 'C' and BATCH = 'F' or 'I', the leading
                2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR upper triangular part of this
                array contains the current upper triangular part of the
                correlation matrix in sequential data processing.
                If ALG = 'F' and BATCH = 'F' or 'I', the array R is not
                referenced.
                On exit, if INFO = 0, ALG = 'Q', and BATCH = 'F' or 'I',
                the leading 2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR upper triangular
                part of this array contains the current upper triangular
                factor R from the QR factorization of the concatenated
                block Hankel matrices. Denote  R_ij, i,j = 1:4,  the
                ij submatrix of  R,  partitioned by M*NOBR,  M*NOBR,
                L*NOBR,  and  L*NOBR  rows and columns.
                On exit, if INFO = 0 and BATCH = 'L' or 'O', the leading
                2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR upper triangular part of
                this array contains the matrix S, the processed upper
                triangular factor R from the QR factorization of the
                concatenated block Hankel matrices, as required by other
                subroutines. Specifically, let  S_ij, i,j = 1:4,  be the
                ij submatrix of  S,  partitioned by M*NOBR,  L*NOBR,
                M*NOBR,  and  L*NOBR  rows and columns. The submatrix
                S_22  contains the matrix of left singular vectors needed
                subsequently. Useful information is stored in  S_11  and
                in the block-column  S_14 : S_44.  For METH = 'M' and
                JOBD = 'M', the upper triangular part of  S_31  contains
                the upper triangular factor in the QR factorization of the
                matrix  R_1c = [ R_12'  R_22'  R_11' ]',  and  S_12
                contains the corresponding leading part of the transformed
                matrix  R_2c = [ R_13'  R_23'  R_14' ]'.  For  METH = 'N',
                the subarray  S_41 : S_43  contains the transpose of the
                matrix contained in  S_14 : S_34.
                The details of the contents of R need not be known if this
                routine is followed by SLICOT Library routine IB01BD.
                On entry, if ALG = 'C', or ALG = 'Q', and BATCH = 'I' or
                'L', the leading  2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR  upper
                triangular part of this array must contain the upper
                triangular matrix R computed at the previous call of this
                routine in sequential data processing. The array R need
                not be set on entry if ALG = 'F' or if BATCH = 'F' or 'O'.
         N       (output) int
                 The estimated order of the system.
                 If  CTRL = 'C',  the estimated order has been reset to a
                 value specified by the user.
       sv      (output) rank-1 rray('d'), dimension ( L*NOBR )
               The singular values used to estimate the system order.

     PURPOSE

     To estimate the system matrices A, C, B, and D, the noise
     covariance matrices Q, Ry, and S, and the Kalman gain matrix K
     of a linear time-invariant state space model, using the
     processed triangular factor R of the concatenated block Hankel
     matrices, provided by SLICOT Library routine IB01AD.

     METHOD

     In the MOESP approach, the matrices  A  and  C  are first
     computed from an estimated extended observability matrix [1],
     and then, the matrices  B  and  D  are obtained by solving an
     extended linear system in a least squares sense.
     In the N4SID approach, besides the estimated extended
     observability matrix, the solutions of two least squares problems
     are used to build another least squares problem, whose solution
     is needed to compute the system matrices  A,  C,  B,  and  D.  The
     solutions of the two least squares problems are also optionally
     used by both approaches to find the covariance matrices.
     The Kalman gain matrix is obtained by solving a discrete-time
     algebraic Riccati equation.

     INPUTS
     -------

     Mode Parameters

             Specifies the subspace identification method to be used,
             as follows:
             = 'M':  MOESP  algorithm with past inputs and outputs;
             = 'N':  N4SID  algorithm;
             = 'C':  combined method:  MOESP  algorithm for finding the
                     matrices A and C, and  N4SID  algorithm for
                     finding the matrices B and D.

     job     CHARACTER*1
             Specifies which matrices should be computed, as follows:
             = 'A':  compute all system matrices, A, B, C, and D;
             = 'C':  compute the matrices A and C only;
             = 'B':  compute the matrix B only;

             Kalman gain matrix are to be computed, as follows:
             = 'C':  the covariance matrices only should be computed;
             = 'K':  the covariance matrices and the Kalman gain
                     matrix should be computed;
             = 'N':  the covariance matrices and the Kalman gain matrix
                     should not be computed.

     nobr    INTEGER
             The number of block rows,  s,  in the input and output
             Hankel matrices processed by other routines.  NOBR > 1.

     n       INTEGER

     l       INTEGER
             The number of system outputs.  L > 0.

     nsmpl   INTEGER
             If  JOBCK = 'C' or 'K',  the total number of samples used
             for calculating the covariance matrices.
             NSMPL >= 2*(M+L)*NOBR.
             This parameter is not meaningful if  JOBCK = 'N'.

     r       rank-2 array type-d, dimension
             ( LDR,2*(M+L)*NOBR )
             On entry, the leading  2*(M+L)*NOBR-by-2*(M+L)*NOBR  part
             of this array must contain the relevant data for the MOESP
             or N4SID algorithms, as constructed by SLICOT Library
             routine IB01AD. Let  R_ij,  i,j = 1:4,  be the
             ij submatrix of  R  (denoted  S  in IB01AD),  partitioned
             by  M*NOBR,  L*NOBR,  M*NOBR,  and  L*NOBR  rows and
             columns. The submatrix  R_22  contains the matrix of left
             singular vectors used. Also needed, for  METH = 'N'  or
             JOBCK <> 'N',  are the submatrices  R_11,  R_14 : R_44,
             and, for  METH = 'M' or 'C'  and  JOB <> 'C', the
             submatrices  R_31  and  R_12,  containing the processed
             matrices  R_1c  and  R_2c,  respectively, as returned by
             SLICOT Library routine IB01AD.
             Moreover, if  METH = 'N'  and  JOB = 'A' or 'C',  the
             block-row  R_41 : R_43  must contain the transpose of the
             block-column  R_14 : R_34  as returned by SLICOT Library
             routine IB01AD.
             The remaining part of  R  is used as workspace.
             On exit, part of this array is overwritten. Specifically,
             if  METH = 'M',  R_22  and  R_31  are overwritten if
                 JOB = 'B' or 'D',  and  R_12,  R_22,  R_14 : R_34,
                 and possibly  R_11  are overwritten if  JOBCK <> 'N';
             if  METH = 'N',  all needed submatrices are overwritten.
             The details of the contents of  R  need not be known if
             this routine is called once just after calling the SLICOT
             Library routine IB01AD.

     A       (input) rank-2 array type-d, dimension
             (LDA,N)
             On entry, if  METH = 'N' or 'C'  and  JOB = 'B' or 'D',
             the leading N-by-N part of this array must contain the
             system state matrix.
             If  METH = 'M'  or  (METH = 'N' or 'C'  and JOB = 'A'
             or 'C'),  this array need not be set on input.

     C       (input) rank-2 array type-d, dimension
             (LDC,N)
             On entry, if  METH = 'N' or 'C'  and  JOB = 'B' or 'D',
             the leading L-by-N part of this array must contain the
             system output matrix.
             If  METH = 'M'  or  (METH = 'N' or 'C'  and JOB = 'A'
             or 'C'),  this array need not be set on input.

     Tolerances

     TOL     DOUBLE
             The tolerance to be used for estimating the rank of
             matrices. If the user sets  TOL > 0,  then the given value
             of  TOL  is used as a lower bound for the reciprocal
             condition number;  an m-by-n matrix whose estimated
             condition number is less than  1/TOL  is considered to
             be of full rank.  If the user sets  TOL <= 0,  then an
             implicitly computed, default tolerance, defined by
             TOLDEF = m*n*EPS,  is used instead, where  EPS  is the
             relative machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
             DLAMCH).

     OUTPUTS
     --------
     A       ( output) rank-2 array type-d, dimension
             (LDA,N)

             state matrix.

     B       (output) rank-2 type('d') array, dimension (LDB,M)
             If  M > 0,  JOB = 'A', 'B', or 'D'  and  INFO = 0,  the
             leading N-by-M part of this array contains the system
             input matrix. If  M = 0  or  JOB = 'C',  this array is
             not referenced.

     C       (output) rank-2 array type-d, dimension
             (LDC,N)
             On exit, if  JOB = 'A' or 'C'  and  INFO = 0,  or

             L-by-N part of this array contains the system output
             matrix.

             If  M > 0,  JOB = 'A' or 'D'  and  INFO = 0,  the leading
             L-by-M part of this array contains the system input-output
             matrix. If  M = 0  or  JOB = 'C' or 'B',  this array is
             not referenced.

     Q       (output) rank-2 type('d') array, dimension (LDQ,N)
             If  JOBCK = 'C' or 'K',  the leading N-by-N part of this
             array contains the positive semidefinite state covariance
             matrix. If  JOBCK = 'K',  this matrix has been used as
             state weighting matrix for computing the Kalman gain.
             This parameter is not referenced if JOBCK = 'N'.

     RY      (output) rank-2 type('d') array, dimension (LDRY,L)
             If  JOBCK = 'C' or 'K',  the leading L-by-L part of this
             array contains the positive (semi)definite output
             covariance matrix. If  JOBCK = 'K',  this matrix has been
             used as output weighting matrix for computing the Kalman
             gain.
             This parameter is not referenced if JOBCK = 'N'.

     S       (output) rank-2 type('d') array, dimension (LDS,L)
             If  JOBCK = 'C' or 'K',  the leading N-by-L part of this
             array contains the state-output cross-covariance matrix.
             If  JOBCK = 'K',  this matrix has been used as state-
             output weighting matrix for computing the Kalman gain.
             This parameter is not referenced if JOBCK = 'N'.

     K       (output) rank-2 type('d') array, dimension ( LDK,L )
             If  JOBCK = 'K',  the leading  N-by-L  part of this array
             contains the estimated Kalman gain matrix.
             If  JOBCK = 'C' or 'N',  this array is not referenced.

    '''
    PURPOSE

    To estimate the initial state and, optionally, the system matrices
    B  and  D  of a linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time system,
    given the system matrices  (A,B,C,D),  or (when  B  and  D  are
    estimated) only the matrix pair  (A,C),  and the input and output
    trajectories of the system. The model structure is :

        x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k),   k >= 0,
        y(k)   = Cx(k) + Du(k),

    where  x(k)  is the  n-dimensional state vector (at time k),
        u(k)  is the  m-dimensional input vector,
        y(k)  is the  l-dimensional output vector,
    and  A, B, C, and D  are real matrices of appropriate dimensions.
    The input-output data can internally be processed sequentially.

    NOTE: THIS IS NOT MORE EFFICIENT THAN CALLING THIS FUNCTION SEPERATELY FOR
    EACH DATA EXPERIMENT

    REQUIRED INPUTS
    ---------------

    Mode Parameters

    JOBX0   {'X', 'N'}
            Specifies whether or not the initial state should be
            computed, as follows:
            = 'X':  compute the initial state x(0);
            = 'N':  do not compute the initial state (possibly,
                    because x(0) is known to be zero).

    COMUSE  {'C', 'U', 'N'}
            Specifies whether the system matrices B and D should be
            computed or used, as follows:
            = 'C':  compute the system matrices B and D, as specified
                    by JOB;
            = 'U':  use the system matrices B and D, as specified by
                    JOB;
            = 'N':  do not compute/use the matrices B and D.
            If  JOBX0 = 'N'  and  COMUSE <> 'N',  then  x(0)  is set
            to zero.
            If  JOBX0 = 'N'  and  COMUSE =  'N',  then  x(0)  is
            neither computed nor set to zero.

    JOB     {'B', 'D'}
            If  COMUSE = 'C'  or  'U',  specifies which of the system
            matrices  B and D  should be computed or used, as follows:
            = 'B':  compute/use the matrix B only (D is known to be
                    zero);
            = 'D':  compute/use the matrices B and D.
            The value of  JOB  is irrelevant if  COMUSE = 'N'  or if
            JOBX0 = 'N'  and  COMUSE = 'U'.
            The combinations of options, the data used, and the
            returned results, are given in the table below, where
            '*'  denotes an irrelevant value.

            For  JOBX0 = 'N'  and  COMUSE = 'N',  the routine just
            sets  DWORK(1)  to 2 and  DWORK(2)  to 1, and returns
            (see the parameter DWORK).
