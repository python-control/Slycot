            The orthogonal matrix Z which reduces the closed-loop system state
            matrix A + B*F to upper real Schur form.

    Raises
    ------

        ValueError : e

                along the diagonal.
             = 3:  the number of eigenvalues to be assigned is less
                than the number of possibly assignable eigenvalues;
                nap eigenvalues have been properly assigned,
                but some assignable eigenvalues remain unmodified.
             = 4:  an attempt is made to place a complex conjugate
                pair on the location of a real eigenvalue. This
                situation can only appear when n-nfp is odd,
                np > n-nfp-nup is even, and for the last real
                eigenvalue to be modified there exists no available
                real eigenvalue to be assigned. However, nap
                eigenvalues have been already properly assigned.

    solution even when matrix R is singular, under mild assumptions

            the user sets TOL > 0, then the given value of TOL is used
            as a lower bound for the reciprocal condition number of
            that matrix; a matrix whose estimated condition number is
            less than 1/TOL is considered to be nonsingular. If the
            user sets TOL <= 0, then a default tolerance, defined by
            TOLDEF = EPS, is used instead, where EPS is the machine
            precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).

            pencil to the ordered generalized real Schur form (S,T).

             the Cholesky factor U of the solution matrix X of the
             problem, X = op(U)**T * op(U).
             If m = 0 and m > 0, then U is set to zero.
         scale : float
             The scale factor set to avoid overflow in U.
             0 < scale <= 1.
         alpha : rank-1 array('c'), shape (n)
             If INFO = 0, 3, 5, 6, or 7, then
             (alpha(j), j=1,...,n, are the
             eigenvalues of the matrix pencil A - lambda * E.
