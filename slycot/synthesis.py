    To solve for X either the continuous-time algebraic Riccati
    equation

    ::

                              -1
        Q + A'X + XA - (L+XB)R  (L+XB)' = 0                       (1)

    or the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation

    ::

                                     -1
        X = A'XA - (L+A'XB)(R + B'XB)  (L+A'XB)' + Q              (2)

    where A, B, Q, R, and L are n-by-n, n-by-m, n-by-n, m-by-m and
    n-by-m matrices, respectively, such that Q = C'C, R = D'D and
    L = C'D; X is an n-by-n symmetric matrix.
    The routine also returns the computed values of the closed-loop
    spectrum of the system, i.e., the stable eigenvalues w(1),
    ..., w(n) of the corresponding Hamiltonian or symplectic
    pencil, in the continuous-time case or discrete-time case,
    respectively.

    Optionally, Q and/or R may be given in a factored form, Q = C'C,
    R = D'D, and L may be treated as a zero matrix.

    The routine uses the method of deflating subspaces, based on
    reordering the eigenvalues in a generalized Schur matrix pair.

    ------
    SlycotArithmeticError
        :info = 1:
            The computed extended matrix pencil is singular,
            possibly due to rounding errors;

            some complex eigenvalues so that leading eigenvalues
            in the (generalized) Schur form no longer satisfy
            the stability condition; this could also be caused
            due to scaling;

            equal n;

    M-by-M and N-by-M matrices, respectively, such that Q = C'C,
    R = D'D and L = C'D; X is an N-by-N symmetric matrix.

    lambda(1),...,lambda(N) of the pencil (A - BF,E), where F is
    the optimal gain matrix,

    Optionally, matrix G = BR  B' may be given instead of B and R.
    Other options include the case with Q and/or R given in a
    factored form, Q = C'C, R = D'D, and with L a zero matrix.

    The routine uses the method of deflating subspaces, based on
    reordering the eigenvalues in a generalized Schur matrix pair.

    It is assumed that E is nonsingular, but this condition is not
    checked. Note that the definition (1) of the continuous-time
    algebraic Riccati equation, and the formula for the corresponding
    optimal gain matrix, require R to be nonsingular, but the
    associated linear quadratic optimal problem could have a unique
    solution even when matrix R is singular, under mild assumptions
    (see METHOD). The routine SG02AD works accordingly in this case.

    Parameters

        of the generalized Schur form, as follows:

        input weighting matrix R. The stricly lower triangular
        part (if UPLO = 'U') or stricly upper triangular part (if
        UPLO = 'L') is not referenced.
        If FACT = 'D' or 'B', the leading P-by-M part of this

            LDWORK >= MAX(7*(2*N+1)+16,16*N,2*N+M,3*M), if JOBB = 'B'.

    tol : float, optional
        The tolerance to be used to test for near singularity of
        the original matrix pencil, specifically of the triangular
        M-by-M factor obtained during the reduction process. If
        the user sets TOL > 0, then the given value of TOL is used
        as a lower bound for the reciprocal condition number of
        that matrix; a matrix whose estimated condition number is
        less than 1/TOL is considered to be nonsingular. If the
        user sets TOL <= 0, then a default tolerance, defined by
        TOLDEF = EPS, is used instead, where EPS is the machine
        precision (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH).
        This parameter is not referenced if JOBB = 'G'.

        reduced matrix pencil associated to the optimal problem,
        corresponding to the scaled Q, R, and L, if JOBB = 'B'
        and SCAL = 'G'. That is,

                   11   12      22

        Array S must have 2*N+M columns if JOBB = 'B', and 2*N
        columns, otherwise.
    T : (2*n, 2*n) ndarray
        The leading 2N-by-2N part of this array contains the
        ordered upper triangular form T of the second matrix in
        the reduced matrix pencil associated to the optimal
        problem, corresponding to the scaled Q, R, and L, if
        JOBB = 'B' and SCAL = 'G'. That is,

        ::

                 (T   T  )

                 (0   T  )
                 (     22)

    U : (2*n, 2*n) ndarray
        The leading 2N-by-2N part of this array contains the right
        transformation matrix U which reduces the 2N-by-2N matrix
        pencil to the ordered generalized real Schur form (S, T).
        That is,

        ::

                 (U   U  )
                 ( 11  12)
             U = (       ),
                 (U   U  )
                 ( 21  22)

            where U  , U  , U   and U   are N-by-N matrices.
                   11   12   21      22

        If JOBB = 'B' and SCAL = 'G', then U corresponds to the
        scaled pencil. If a basis for the stable deflating
        subspace of the original problem is needed, then the
        submatrix U_21   must be multiplied by the scaling factor
        contained in DWORK(4).

        if the default (None) value is used, the size for good performance

        cache size will be used.

            The determinant of ``Im2 + Tu*D11HAT*Ty*D22`` is zero
            [3]_.

    Notes
    -----
    Method
        The routine implements the Glover's and Doyle's 1988 formulas [1]_,
        [2]_ modified to improve the efficiency as described in [3]_.
    Numerical Aspects
        The accuracy of the result depends on the condition numbers of the
        input and output transformations and on the condition numbers of
        the two Riccati equations, as given by the values of `rcond[0:4]`
