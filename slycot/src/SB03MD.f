C
C     To solve for X either the real continuous-time Lyapunov equation
C
C        op(A)'*X + X*op(A) = scale*C                             (1)
C
C     or the real discrete-time Lyapunov equation
C
C        op(A)'*X*op(A) - X = scale*C                             (2)
C
C     and/or estimate an associated condition number, called separation,
C     where op(A) = A or A' (A**T) and C is symmetric (C = C').
C     (A' denotes the transpose of the matrix A.) A is N-by-N, the right
C     hand side C and the solution X are N-by-N, and scale is an output
C     scale factor, set less than or equal to 1 to avoid overflow in X.

C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER

C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value;
C             > 0:  if INFO = i, the QR algorithm failed to compute all
C                   the eigenvalues (see LAPACK Library routine DGEES);
C                   elements i+1:n of WR and WI contain eigenvalues
C                   which have converged, and A contains the partially
C                   converged Schur form;

C                   common or very close eigenvalues, or
C                   if DICO = 'D', and matrix A has almost reciprocal
C                   eigenvalues (that is, lambda(i) = 1/lambda(j) for
C                   some i and j, where lambda(i) and lambda(j) are
C                   eigenvalues of A and i <> j); perturbed values were
C                   used to solve the equation (but the matrix A is
C                   unchanged).
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The Schur factorization of a square matrix  A  is given by
C
C        A = U*S*U'
C
C     where U is orthogonal and S is block upper triangular with 1-by-1
C     and 2-by-2 blocks on its diagonal, these blocks corresponding to
C     the eigenvalues of A, the 2-by-2 blocks being complex conjugate
C     pairs. This factorization is obtained by numerically stable
C     methods: first A is reduced to upper Hessenberg form (if FACT =
C     'N') by means of Householder transformations and then the
C     QR Algorithm is applied to reduce the Hessenberg form to S, the
C     transformation matrices being accumulated at each step to give U.
C     If A has already been factorized prior to calling the routine
C     however, then the factors U and S may be supplied and the initial
C     factorization omitted.
C                   _            _

C     FURTHER COMMENTS
C
C     If DICO = 'C', SEP is defined as the separation of op(A) and
C     -op(A)':
C
C            sep( op(A), -op(A)' ) = sigma_min( T )
C
C     and if DICO = 'D', SEP is defined as
C
C            sep( op(A), op(A)' ) = sigma_min( T )
C
C     where sigma_min(T) is the smallest singular value of the
C     N*N-by-N*N matrix
C
C       T = kprod( I(N), op(A)' ) + kprod( op(A)', I(N) )  (DICO = 'C'),
C
C       T = kprod( op(A)', op(A)' ) - I(N**2)              (DICO = 'D').
C
C     I(x) is an x-by-x identity matrix, and kprod denotes the Kronecker
C     product. The program estimates sigma_min(T) by the reciprocal of
C     an estimate of the 1-norm of inverse(T). The true reciprocal
C     1-norm of inverse(T) cannot differ from sigma_min(T) by more
C     than a factor of N.
C
C     When SEP is small, small changes in A, C can cause large changes
C     in the solution of the equation. An approximate bound on the
C     maximum relative error in the computed solution is
C
C                      EPS * norm(A) / SEP      (DICO = 'C'),
C
C                      EPS * norm(A)**2 / SEP   (DICO = 'D'),
C
C     where EPS is the machine precision.
